								<h2>Info</h2>
								<p>My name is Yorick-Ntwari Niyonkuru, born and raised in Montreal and perfectly bilingual (English and French). My passion is learning new programming technologies and building software products. My goal is to turn my passion into a career and bring about as much impact as I can with my skills.  </p>
								<h2>Internship Experience</h2>
								<p>Main responsibilites were setting up PC desktops, firewalls and Windows Server 2012 as well as debugging dysfunctional. </p>
								<!--<p>I was lucky enough to meet Francois Michaud, CEO of <a href="http://www.oriso.com/">Oriso Solutions</a> by pure chance. He seemed to be impressed by my enthousiasm towards my ongoing Computer Science degree and offered me a summer intership. I wasn't doing much at first, installing Windows and Linux on multiple desktops and firewalls that he was planning on selling. Later, I was in chargre of figuring out what the problems were with the devices that wouldn't start. I mainly used my intuition (and a bit of help from Google at times) to fix what I could. For example, one of the firewalls wasn't turning on but had a certain beeping sound. I knew that beep meant there was either something wrong with the RAM or the motherboard. After opening up the case, it was only then I noticed there was no ram installed at all, and Francois was impressed I was able to notice. </p>-->
								<p>Three things I learned from working at Oriso Solutions: overcoming shyness when asking for help, understanding how software relates to business needs, and practicing debugging skills. </p>
								
								<h2>Other</h2>
								<p>Volunteered at <a href="https://www.maisonshalom.org">Maison Shalom</a> in Kigali, Rwanda. Distributed clothes and living necessities to Burundian refugees, as well as planning and organizing the launch of a fundraising campaign for Oasis of Peace movement to help raise money online to build an elementary and high school for refugees coming from neighboring country of Burundi, currently experiencing much political unrest.</p>
								<p>My main hobby is simply surfing the web to see what interesting computer science concepts I can learn and building whatever I can as can be seen on the Homepage. However, I do have other interests such as making <a href="assets/downloads/Music.zip" download>beats</a> on FL Studio, playing basketball and watching anime. </p>
