								<h2>Info</h2>
								<p>Born and raised in Montreal and perfectly bilingual (English and French), my interest in technology goes back as far as I can remember. It mainly started off with trying to understand how some of my favorite video games worked, mainly Pokemon and Minecraft. Gaming has always been a hobby of mine, however, I found I was only ever attracted to strategy or creative games. After my first computer science class, I was instantly hooked by how much fun designing, building and debugging software was. I wasted no time trying my best to stay ahead of my class with personal projects I always had on the side. Not all of them worked exactly how I wanted them to, but no matter what, I knew progress was progress. What made me truly love programming however was collaborating with my friends and trying to build things or solve problems together. Once we had become familiar working with each other and became better at verbalizing our ideas and intentions, this made workflow a lot easier.</p>
								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<p>I was lucky enough to meet Francois Michaud, CEO of <a href="http://www.oriso.com/">Oriso Solutions</a> by pure chance. He seemed to be impressed by my enthousiasm towards my ongoing Computer Science degree and offered me a summer intership. I wasn't doing much at first, installing Windows and Linux on multiple desktops and firewalls that he was planning on selling. Later, I was in chargre of figuring out what the problems were with the devices that wouldn't start. I mainly used my intuition (and a bit of help from Google at times) to fix what I could. For example, one of the firewalls wasn't turning on but had a certain beeping sound. I knew that beep meant there was either something wrong with the RAM or the motherboard. After opening up the case, it was only then I noticed there was no ram installed at all, and Francois was impressed I was able to notice. </p>
								<p>Three things I learned from working at Oriso Solutions: overcoming shyness of asking for help, understanding how software relates to business needs, and practicing debugging skills</p>
								<h2>Other</h2>
								<p>Volunteered at <a href="https://www.maisonshalom.org">Maison Shalom</a> in Kigali, Rwanda. Helped bag clothes and living necessities to Burundian refugees, as well as planning and organizing the launch of a fundraising campaign for Oasis of Peace movement to help raise money online to build an elementary and high school for refugees coming from the politically unrest neighboring country of Burundi.</p>
								<p>My main hobby is simply surfing the web to see what interesting computer science concepts I can learn and building whatever I can as can be seen on the Homepage. However, I do have other interests such as making <a href="assets/downloads/Music.zip" download>beats</a> on FL Studio, playing basketball and watching anime. </p>
